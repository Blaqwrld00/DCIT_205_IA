                        <p>For more over 40 years, our department of computer science has been offering top-notch computing instruction and research.
                            From software engineering to artificial intelligence (AI) to security, our five knowledgeable faculty members cover it all.
                         
                           Our undergraduate and graduate degree programs are created to provide students with the best possible balance of information that is both theoretical and practical.
                            This makes it possible for our graduates to succeed in computer jobs at top IT firms and research centers.
                           
                           Our environment of creativity and discovery around computing and technology is fostered by our superb teachers, bright young students, creative corporate links, and state-of-the-art facilities.
                            New students, instructors, partners, and collaborators who are enthusiastic about our field's future are all welcome.</p>
